# bloc_test

A real-world example of using the BLoC pattern in Flutter. This app features a searchable list of users and demonstrates an elegant way to keep the UI in sync with the model.

## Features
The app implements the following features:
- user list and detail pages
- user management
  - add single user
  - slide to remove single user with undo
  - favorite / unfavorite button
- multi-select mode (long-press and icon tap)
  - selection counter
  - favorite multiple users
  - delete multiple users with undo
- searchbar for filtering users
- real-time status
  - online status indicator per user
  - user statistics

## BLoC
Proper separation of concerns by using the Business Logic Component pattern. Heavily relies on streams to notify the UI of changes in the business layer. No 3rd-party package dependencies, just plain Flutter.
